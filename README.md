# Kidney-Segnet
Implementation of Kidney-Segnet: Efficient deep learning architecture with dimension-wise pyramid pooling for nuclei segmentation of histopathology images 

![](./diagrams/encoder_aspp_decoder.png)

## Description
Image segmentation is a well explored task in the computer vision domain. However, the standard convolution operations performed in CNNs are inefficient in memory and computation. We address this issue by using dimension-wise convolutions (DiCE blocks) in an attention based encoder-decoder framework to make our network more efficient and effective. Moreover, in order to capture multi-scale information effectively, we use DiCE based atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) on dense feature maps in the encoder-decoder framework. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Python >= 3.6
* Pytorch == 1.9


### Installing
```
  git clone https://github.com/Aaatresh/kidney-segnet
```

### Data
The data this network was trained on H&E stained histopathology images of kidney and breast tissue. The kidney and breast datasets were obtained from [Crowdsourcing image
annotation for nucleus detection and segmentation in computational pathology: Evaluating experts, automated methods, and
the crowd][1] and [Segmentation of Nuclei in Histopathology Images by Deep Regression of the Distance Map][2] respectively.

### Running the Code
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab can be used to open this notebook. Make sure you clone this repository before opening the notebook and running its cells.
